    <h1>Measure your heart rate</h1>
    <p>Note: The results from this can be very high or low, and can be inaccurate. This requires your camera.</p>
    <p>The camera and subject should have as little motion as possible. There should be good lighting, and it can take a few seconds to get results.</p>
